 is an essential part of our daily life. One famous English saying goes “We are what we eat”, and it’s true. The food we eat can influence our body and our mind. It contains nutrients, such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrates. Different products contain different nutrients. For example, we can get lots of vitamins eating fruit and vegetables. As for me, I like salads very much but I don’t like meat products. The food we choose to eat depends on many factors. First and the most important is the taste. If we like the taste of the product, we often eat it. The second factor is its nutritional value. If the product is healthy and useful for our body, we should add it to our ration.</font><font size=+2>
