<font size=+2>I was born and raised in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</a>
. City in Western Kazakhstan, the administrative center of the Aktobe region and the city administration of the same name.
Aktobe is located in the west of Kazakhstan, in the northern part of the Aktobe region. Area - 428.469 kmÂ². Aktobe ranks fourth among the cities of Kazakhstan in terms of the number of inhabitants and is the largest city in Western Kazakhstan. Population - 500,757 people (early 2020). The ethnic composition is very diverse. The most numerous are Kazakhs (79%) and Russians (14.8%). The predominant religion of the townspeople is Islam and Christianity. The emerging Aktobe agglomeration, which in the future should "accommodate" 1.3 million people, includes several dozen settlements near Aktobe. The climate in the city is sharply continental. This is due to the location of the city in the inner part of the Eurasian continent and a significant distance from the oceans. The sharp continentality of the climate manifests itself in temperature contrasts between daytime and nighttime, between winter and summer, as well as in the abundance of solar radiation and aridity. In winter, the weather in Aktobe is under the influence of a deep cyclone over Iceland (Icelandic minimum) and a powerful Siberian anticyclone centered over Mongolia. Under the influence of these factors, large baric gradients are formed, directed from the south-east to the north-west.</font><font size=+2>
