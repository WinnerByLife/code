<font size=+2>If you ask me about my hobbies and preferences, I will start my story with my favorite<a href="http://www.jut.su///">basketball</a>
. Of course, many people enjoy playing sports and playing sports games. But for me, basketball is the best game in the world. This type of sports game is not the most popular in my country. Although, we also have teams and the opportunity to play basketball. Unfortunately, it is not as popular as hockey or football. This is probably why I am so curious about this game. In the future, I would like to visit America and go to a basketball game. It's so cool to see the best players in the world and watch the athletes live. I am very glad that this wonderful game once entered my life. During this time, I became taller, more resilient and more confident in myself.</font><font size=+2>
